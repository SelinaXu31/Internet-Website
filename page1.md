# The Invention Of Internet

### The History of Internet
   The Internet was created for the Government to share information inside their own system in 1960. At this time, the computer was a gigantic machine that only very few departments or schools owned. Also, because of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the US needed a way to transmit messages even after the attack by unclear. Finally, they formed the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) which was the very first generation of the Internet. Raymond Tomlinson was the one who created Email which was called a killing application after the invention of ARPANET and the sign @ was also created by him. On January 1, 1983, a protocol called Internetwork Protocol (IP) was established as a universe standard "computer language" by Kahn and Cerf. This protocol allows various computers with no different network to communicate with each other.    


 
### Important Inventors
   Throughout the history of the Internet, many people were contributed to it, however, for most of us, we only know the applications that we are still using nowadays, instead of the inventors who deserve the credits.

##### ARPA
   In 1962, a scientist from M.I.T. and ARPA named J.C.R. Licklider proposed a solution to this problem: a “galactic network” of computers that could talk to one another. 

###### M.I.T. scientist
   In 1965, another M.I.T. scientist developed a way of sending information from one computer to another that he called “packet switching.” 
   
###### ARPANET   
   In 1969, ARPANET delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” between UCLA and Standford. 
   
##### Vinton Cerf   
   By the end of 1971, Vinton Cerf developed TCP(Transmission Control Protocol). 
   
##### Tim Berners-Lee    
   In 1991, a computer programmer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not only simply a way to send files but also was itself a “web” of information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve.



### How does Internet Works
   Different people have a different understanding of the Internet and explained by the founder which is a result of another experiment called the ARPANET that helped with the communication problem. Who controls the internet? The answer is nobody or everybody. Internet ships binary information. 1 is on, 0 is off. How to transfer information? By electricity (too slow), by light (fiber, fast but too expensive), by radio (wireless, too short). May change in the future. Internet Protocols are important than how the internet physically works. Information is assembled by various packets and transferred by different routes。
