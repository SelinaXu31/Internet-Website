### How does Internet Works ###
  We are all familiar with the famous Microsoft. Throughout many years, Microsoft has been able to uphold their position in the technology relm. Even amongst their competitors such as Apple, Google and IBM, they have still managed to keep their throne. However, their tactic has not always been fail and legal. Netscape, a company that not many people know of, because of Microsoft, was their main victim during the early 1990's.

  Mosaic, what soon became to be known as, Netscape was created in the Fall of 1993 by four college students who were fascinated by the World Wide Web, Rob McCool, Alex Toxic, Kou Montuli and Marc Andreessen. These four would soon be known as the "Illinois Geeks." When starting the creation Andreessen wanted to create a useful web for ones everyday life. This included having the ability to add videos, photos, etc. Something that would eventually turn into a point and click software and would soon become a graphical web browser. The Illinois Geeks launched Mosaic as a free download and that was a revolutionary moment for the internet world. Jim Clark --more background on him-- invested in Mosaic and partnered with the Illinois Geeks to soon start the creation of Netscape.
  
 #### Microsoft ####
  Microsoft, was created by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in April of 1975. Gates was a fresh Harvard Dropout when he launched his well known brand. His vision has always been to have a PC in every desktop, home and office running on Microsoft software and in the 1993 he was very close to his goal. Out of all the computers, at least 90% of them were installed with his software. However, Gates strongly believed that people should pay to use the web rather than getting free access to it.
