Welcome and thank you for visiting what I've worked so hard to create. This all started as an assignment from my Professor who instructed us to create a website 
from scratch about the internet. Once learning all the material that would soon be incorporated into my website, I realized that I wish this was something taught
to me earlier in life, ideally around high school. Therefore, this website is directed towards the young teenagers who would like to learn more about the history
and wars between some of the most infamous companies. What started off as an assignment became something dear to my heart.
